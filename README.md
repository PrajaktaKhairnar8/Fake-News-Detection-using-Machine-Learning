# Fake-News-Detection-using-Machine-Learning
Fake news detection using machine learning involves developing algorithms and models that can automatically identify and classify misleading or false information in news articles or other content.These systems analyze various features such as language patterns, source credibility, and contextual information to differentiate between genuine and fake news. By leveraging machine learning techniques, such as natural language processing and pattern recognition, these models aim to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of identifying misinformation, contributing to the mitigation of its spread and impact on public perception.
